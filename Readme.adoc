Set ACL recursively on files and folder from an easy to read configuration (macOS only).


== How to Use?

First you have to create a config file which will describe the different ACLs to
apply to which folders and files.

Then, simply run `chacl --admin-username admin /path/to/config/file`. The admin
username is required, because ACLs are added for it to be able to access
everything whatever the configuration file says.

Here is an example config file:
[source,sh]
